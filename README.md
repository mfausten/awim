# AWIM - A Work Interruption Manager

Your favourite song is playing and like **always** the evil project manager comes in and wants to talk to you.
Finally he is gone, but usually the next song has almost finished.

With this simple Firefox AddOn, you can easily stop/resume your Spotify stream. No manually going back in the playlist - ever again.

Requires only "tabs" [permission](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/permissions)

## How to use

Either click on the extension button in your browser toolbar or use the default shortcut `Strg+Shift+E` to start/stop your stream

## TODO

* Maybe add previous/next support
* I don't like the logo
* Would be cool if the logo would change on the state of the video paused/running, if possible
* Before this addon could handle YouTube streams, maybe it is possible to add this again
