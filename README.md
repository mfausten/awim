# AWIM - A Work Interruption Manager

Your favourite song is playing and like **always** the evil project manager comes in and wants to talk to you.
Finally he is gone, but usually the next song has almost finished.

With this simple Firefox AddOn, you can easily stop/resume your YouTube stream. No manually going back in the playlist - ever.

## Known bugs

* If you have different firefox installations and use them at the same time, the addon will stop working till only one version is running - doesn't matter how many instances

## TODO

* Add keyboard short cut, so we don't need to click the button
* Maybe add "next" support
